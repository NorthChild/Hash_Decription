# Hash Decription using PHP
decrypting passwords using php 

this is a very simple program divided in three sections:
1. index.php
      - Insert a md5 hash code and it will be decripted (<= 4 characthers)
      - show the first 15 attempts
      - print out how long it took to decript
2. md5.php
      - convert 4 numbers into hash (only 4 and only numbers)

3. makecode.php
      - convert any length password into dm5 hash
